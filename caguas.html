                <p>
                    The area of the Valley of Caguas was first settled by the Saladoid culture, an Arawak culture which originated 
                    in northern South America (today Venezuela), approximately between the years 100 BCE to 600 CE. Findings from 
                    the Cagüitas archaeological site (CS-2) indicate that the area was later inhabited by various pre-Taíno (Ostionoid)
                    cultures which first developed agriculture in the valley, primarily the cultivation of cassava, and hunted now 
                    extinct species such as hutias. As with the rest of Puerto Rico, the Taínos were the primary group living in 
                    the valley at the time of the Spanish arrival. The Spanish conquistadors further developed the agriculture in 
                    the valley, while also establishing mines in search of gold, silver and copper. Most of the native Taínos living 
                    in the area were either forced out or taken as slaves and moved to the Real Hacienda del Toa 
                    (in modern-day Toa Alta and Toa Baja). Most of the valley was later cleared of its original vegetation for the 
                    development of cattle farms such as Hato de Bairoa, Hato de Caguax and Hato de Gurabo.

                    Caguas was officially founded on January 1, 1775, as San Sebastián del Piñal de Caguax, with the name later
                    being shortened and modernized to its current form. The name of the city comes from Caguax, a local Taíno chief
                    and early convert to Christianity. The site of the historic downtown area of Caguas and its central square dates
                    to 1779. In 1820 the settlement was granted the title of Villa and it was granted city rights in 1894. Sugarcane 
                    was the primary crop during this time and important sugarcane plantations and refineries were those of 
                    Central Santa Juana (close to modern day Plaza Centro) and Central Santa Catalina (modern day Las Catalinas Mall).
                    The Carretera Central, which is the first paved road to cross Puerto Rico from north to south connecting San Juan
                    to Ponce, was built during the last two decades of the 19th century, made Caguas more accessible therefore
                    causing the population of the town to grow even more.

                    Puerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish–American War under the terms of the Treaty of 
                    Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States. In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted 
                    a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Caguas was 19,857.

                        To stimulate local tourism during the COVID-19 pandemic in Puerto Rico, the Puerto Rico Tourism Company
                        launched the Voy Turistiendo (I'm Touring) campaign in 2021. The campaign featured a passport book with
                        a page for each municipality. The Voy Turisteando Caguas passport page lists the Jardín Botánico William
                        Miranda Marin, the Catedral Dulce Nombre de Jesús, the Plaza de Recreo Santiago R. Palmer and the Museo
                        de Artes Populares as places of interest for locals
